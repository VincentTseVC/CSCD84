Answer the following questions. Be concise and clear
but explain carefully when needed.

1 .- (1 marks) Of BFS and DFS, which search algorithm yields the best results? (i.e. which is more likely
     to get the mouse to the cheese safely before being eaten?)
BFS.

2 .- (1 marks) Does this mean that in general BFS is a better search algorithm? (yes/no and give reasons to
     support your answer based on your observations)
No, one of the main factors that affect the performance of DFS compared to BFS is that we call the search several times. BFS consistently returns the minimum path, but the path DFS returns is 'arbitrary' and could be extremly different from the path before.

3 .- (2 marks) Describe the heuristic function you used for A* search. Why is this heuristic admissible?
The heuristic function we used is the absolute difference of the x and y coordinates between the position we are interested in to the closest cheese. This heuristic is admissible because the minimum path we need to take, if no wall existed, is going up/down to the same level as the mouse and then going right/left until we find the closest cheese. This is the exact distance our function returns.

4 .- (1 marks) Explain how your heuristic function accounts for the presence of multiple cheeses.
The heurstic uses the closest cheese so it can be guarenteed that it is admissible.

5 .- (1 marks) Is A* equivalent to BFS for this problem? or is it better/worse? explain your answer based on 
     your observations.
No, A* puts so little emphasis to the nodes in the opposite direction that the visited nodes matches very closely to the path compared to BFS.

6 .- (2 marks) Describe your heuristic function for A*-nokitty. How does it work? what factors are considered
     into the cost function? is it admissible (yes/no and why)?
A*-nokitty takes in 4 factors:
1. The sum of the distances from the mouse to each cat. The further the sum of distances, the lower the heuristic.
2. The distance from the mouse to the closest cat. The further the distance, the higher the heuristic. This values significantly increases the heuristic (by factor of 1/x where x is the distance)
3. The sum of the distances from the mouse to each cheese. The further the sum of distances, the larger the heuristic.
4. The distance from the mouse to the closest cheese. The further the distance, the lower the heuristic. This values significantly decreases the heuristic (by factor of 1/x where x is the distance)

No, it is not admissible because if a cat is near, the heuristic siginificantly increases even if it's close to a cheese.


7 .- (2 marks) What is the largest limitation of the search algorithms implemented in this assignment?
     (i.e. is there anything we are missing that could lead to a smarter mouse?) - this is
     a more or less open question, but we talked about it in lecture!

We don't know how driver is implemented so we can't predict the movements of the cats (sometimes the cheese). It is difficult to find a path that does not cross with any of the paths the cat can take so in essence, we are reacting to the movements of the cat rather than planning for it.

Marking:

(5 marks) Correctly implementing BFS - the search
          runs and produces the expected search
          behaviour.

(5 marks) Correctly implementing DFS - the search
          runs and produces the expected behaviour.

(5 marks)  A* heuristic function is implemented, reasonable,
           and admissible.

(10 marks) Correctly implementing A* search - the search
           runs and produces the expected behaviour.

(10 marks) Implemented a **clever**  A*-nokitty heuristic
           and a working A*-nokitty search. The search
           should produce a smarter mouse than all of
           BFS/DFS/A*.

           The heuristic should accounts for known game 
           factors that affect the mouse's chance of success.

           (to be marked competitively - smartest mouse
            in the class earns full marks)

(10 marks) Answers in this report file

(up to 15 marks) Assigned by the TA based on how smart your
		 mouse actually is. Mind what is going on in
		 the game, and think about how to make your
		 mouse most likely to win!
